# Fastag Fraud Detection

## Overview
Fastag Fraud Detection is a machine learning project aimed at developing a real-time fraud detection system for Fastag transactions. Fastag is an electronic toll collection system used on highways to facilitate seamless travel and reduce congestion. However, fraudulent activities within the Fastag system pose significant challenges, leading to financial losses and compromised security. This project seeks to address these challenges by leveraging historical transaction data and advanced machine learning algorithms.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing: Extracted relevant features from transaction data including time-based features, transaction behavior features, and geographical location features.
- Model development: Trained machine learning models, including Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression, to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Evaluation metrics: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Real-time fraud detection: Implemented real-time fraud detection capabilities to enhance security measures within the Fastag system.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes transaction data such as Transaction ID, Timestamp, Vehicle Type, Transaction Amount, Amount Paid, and Fraud Indicator (target variable).

## Model Performance
- Achieved high levels of accuracy(98%), precision, recall (100%), and F1-score, indicating the effectiveness of the model in detecting fraudulent transactions.
- Conducted comprehensive analysis of model performance using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score.
